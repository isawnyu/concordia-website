3	namespace prefixes in atom feeds freak out rssowl	thomase	thomase	RSSOwl is evidently not namespace aware, or at least there's a bug in its namespace prefix handling capabilities (if it even has them). The upshot is that a feed like the one that [source:epidoc2atom/trunk/tei2entry.xsl@1 our xslt] currently generates will fail to display. So much for degrading gracefully. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that this sort of problem occurs in other feedreaders too.\r\n\r\nSo, we need to ensure that all our stylesheets produce feeds that don't employ namespace prefixes.	defect	closed	critical	Feeds for IAph 2007	xslts		fixed
