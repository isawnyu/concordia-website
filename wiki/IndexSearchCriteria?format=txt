= Index Search Criteria =

An important specification component for ConcordiaHarvester.

== Types of search ==

 * Given an item (url) in one collection, find all "related" items in other collections, regardless of type

 * Find things that attest to a given item (url)

 * How much of each dataset's own intrinsic properties do we allow users to search against?

 * (sub)string(s) in title and/or description (text search)

 * Given an item (url), find all related items in other collections whose relation type is one or more values from our vocabulary (search by our predicates)

 * Constrain type of item returned (we need a ConcordiaTypeThesaurus)

 * Spatial search in recognizable structured data (e.g., gml-namespaced; GeoRSS in Atom; specify a region and find within)

 * Date search in recognizable structured data (e.g., TEI/EpiDoc: begin/end)
