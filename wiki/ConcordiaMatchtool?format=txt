concordia.matchtool is a framework for defining and executing rulesets to 
effect matching of records in two datasets. The original use case is getting
matches between print-style BAtlas citations held in the IAph2007 
inscriptions collection and Barrington Atlas IDs. Another early use case
is matching content extracted from the Barrington Atlas Directory
compilation files against feature data digitized from Barrington Atlas
compilation maps.
