''back to ProjectDeliverables''

A complete set of stable identifiers for every citable feature in the Barrington Atlas was identified by participants in the [WorkshopMay Concordia May Workshop] as an urgent prerequisite to establishing services, given the timetable for inclusion of data in Pleiades. It was not a consideration in the original proposal, but clearly of such value for laying the groundwork that we have added it as a main data deliverable of the project.
