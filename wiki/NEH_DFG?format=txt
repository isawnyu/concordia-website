In February 2009 [http://www.neh.gov/ NEH] and [http://www.dfg.de/en/index.html DFG] awarded a grant to fund two workshops, the first one in [wiki:NEH_DFGworkshopOne Heidelberg] and the second in [wiki:NEH_DFGworkshopTwo New York]. The aim of these meetings is to explore and plan various modes of integration and complementation between on the one hand the current development work being done on [http://www.atlantides.org/trac/pleiades/ Pleiades] and the [http://www.atlantides.org/trac/pleiades/wiki/BAtlas Barrington Atlas] and on the other hand the continuous entry of data to the Epigraphic Database Heidelberg ([http://www.epigraphische-datenbank-heidelberg.de/ EDH]).
