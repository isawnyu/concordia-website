= Project Management Lessons =

What have we learnt so far about project management that would be useful for future collaborations - between us or between others?

 * importance of regular communication (obvious, but not overstated)
   * skype/teleconf meetings
 * hazards and benefits of multiple issuetracker/SVN instances
   * local staff not involved in cross-institution communication under-informed
   * relationship between project-level (joint) issue tracker and institutional or departmental issue tracker(s)
   * issue trackers taking on life of their own and overwhelming actual work completion?
   * think about how you're going to handle this stuff before/as you get started (include as a rubric in proposal)
 * travel costs: participants' institution pays
 * google docs (good or bad?)
 * wikis (good or bad?)
   * what they mean for the participants
   * what they mean for funders
   * what they mean for dissemination
 * meetings?
   * relationship with reporting (report as agenda and minutes)
   * newly formed teams could benefit greatly from a "launch" meeting/workshop very early in the performance period
 * time-frame
   * one-year time frame is very short (too short if you're not already collaborating closely)
   * generally, a 3-4 month incubation or ramp-up period (or earlier notification of award) would better allow for putting personnel, systems, contracts in place
