=== Summary Points ===

 * Concordia approaches search from the web search engine angle. This is not federated search. We are building an index from the data collected by a web crawler.
 * Our new vocabulary of link rels bears some resemblance to a group of RDF predicates, but Concordia is not a semantic web application.
