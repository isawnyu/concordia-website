   * From Penn Station, there are various options for getting to the hotel, depending on the time of day. Generally, the best option involves first a subway trip and then a crosstown bus (detailed below). You can try other options using the excellent [http://tripplanner.mta.info/ Metropolitan Transportation Authority Trip Planner] (but be warned, it often recommends the M-4 bus, which is notoriously slow).
