== Agenda ==

 * please add proposed topical bullets here
 * Discussion and development of [wiki:EDHgeographyTable EDH geography database]
   * How do we deal with the creation new Pleiades identifier, because EDH has found a new ancient name which the Barrington missed / could not have had.
   * Enumerate use cases.
 * Discussion of [http://concordia.atlantides.org/examples/edh-mockups/glamoc.html Mock up] for demonstration of cooperation between EDH and Pleiades.
 * Discussion of potential and steps for more !EpiDoc functionality for EDH
 * Planning for future work.
   * Application for money to be provided to employ persons for EDH and Pleiades for a two to three year period?
 * Specific discussions of the interfaces what info can we ask for between the two systems, atom feeds sparql etc.

 * Thursday
   * Geography and Pleiades in action
     * Coding for these things
   * better search of Pleiades
     * review Heidelberg "spec"
   * check correspondence between Pleiades and modern (e.g. Geonames) coordinates
     * visual / map check
   * Pleiades can discover EDH geographic relationships dynamically (Concordia style atom feeds)
   * Notification of Pleiades updates
     * feed of changes
     * pubsub model?
   * geographic representations for users (EDH presentation / use of Pleiades way of showing its information on this)
   * geographical search capability of what we might want to add
   * Trismegistos / EAGLE
   * EBH bibliography database with identifiers look to the future and how we might implement

 * Afternoon session
   * Structure of Crawler / Index / Search Interface. See appended jpgs below.
   * HD geographic aspects. What HD needs from Pleiades. Match Interface.
     * When EDH does not have a record in the !GeoDatabase. Click a button related to !GeoIdentifier which triggers a match interface action with Pleiades. Pleiades sends back a list / identifications on a map. Once the person makes the identifaction then a click creates the new !GeoDatabase entry.
     * browser tab 1 !GeoDatabase; browser tab 2 Pleiades Form 

 * Friday
   * Look at SoSOL in action
   * Discus !EpiDoc in the framework of having seen SoSOL working
   * Prototype a batch search: PlaceMatching

 * Possibility of introducing a new box on the result set of any given EDH search, in which both EDH modern findspot and Pleiades Ancient findspot on the same map.
   * modern map basse from google
   * pleiades location via kml
   * coordinates held by EDH with an appropriate label
   * link to Pleiades 
   * link to origin of the most specific coordinates (often Geonames, but not always)

 * Afternoon session
   * return briefly to mock up - we are happy that we captured everything we need and want in the above description of the new box.
   * How do we deal with the creation new Pleiades identifier, because EDH has found a new ancient name which the Barrington missed / could not have had. And corrections.
     * Workspaces in Pleiades
   * Return to categories of "bei", "inter"
     * data model must accommodate as many as
       * 2 pleiades URLs: fo_antik inter
       * 2 coordinate pairs: fo_modern zwischen
       * 2 Geonames URLs: as a complement to double fo_modern entry
   * CIL and other corpus/edition maps scanning why what use (see MapList made in July)?
     * Reason: supply coordinates for (modern) named sites that are only known through the corpus publication itself (or seem so)
     * Once maps are scanned, possible to do rectification via http://maps.nypl.org/warper/ ??
     * TE to contact Harvard, Tufts about already-scanned maps
   * geographical search capability of what we might want to add
     * possibilities from the user perspective:
       * select a place by name, then enter a radius distance
       * use a map to draw a rectangle, which then functions as a bounding box for the search
     * technical requirements
       * extend db2 functionality to support spatial indexing/query
         * IBM Spatial Extender (not free?)
       * modify middleware and user interface to support entry and addition of spatial query aspects
       * significant programming and testing commitment; difficult to assess how much without knowing more about what's required in terms of database add-ons and their configuration
   * Trismegistos / EAGLE
   * EBH bibliography database with identifiers look to the future and how we might implement
     * EBH idno 1437 is a really nice example

Dont forget to photocopy receipts, I-94s etc.

 * Saturday 
   * Next steps
   * How we think of stuff for an application
