Discovery and Citation
======================

The Concordia [1_] project is applying principles of Web Architecture [2_] and
search engine methods to the study of the ancient world. Its principal
objectives are:

 1. To help information designers and developers discover external web resources
    that provide evidence supporting the authenticity or historicity of their
    own web resources.
  
 2. To assist the same parties in discovering external web resources which cite
    their own web resources.
  
 3. To do so at the least expense, using proven and readily available methods.

To Concordia, discovery is a feature that emerges naturally from the Web,
and is assisted by conventional search engine methods.

Richard Cygniak has produced an evocative picture of linked datasets [3_]:

Concordia aims to take the first steps toward creation of such a network for
the study of the ancient world.

To date, the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) [4_] has not played a role
in creating an open, world-wide graph of ancient world data (see further,
below). Concordia will defer implementation of the CRM and opt to catalyze the
graph with a different, smaller, and not exclusionary vocabulary that better
suits resources that are published on the web today.

Resources and Relationships
===========================

Information about the ancient world on the web today is communicated via web
pages. These pages describe coins, inscriptions, persons, places, and other
entities. They are either created directly by human authors or – in the case of
many collections and reference works – are backed by relational databases or
XML document collections. Such pages are linked consistently to other entities
within their own sites or domains. There is little linking between entities of
different domains, and what linking exists tends to be at a gross level. For
example, the home page of a web site about ancient places might link to the
home page of a site about inscriptions or coins, but linking between individual
entities across sites is a nascent practice. 

Concordia proposes to increase the linking of related resources across domains
(e.g., coins to places to inscriptions to persons, all potentially on different
sites). The resulting graph will represent a certain level of knowledge about
the ancient world, knowledge that can be acted upon by software agents such as
web crawlers or spiders, and indexed by search engines.  

At a recent workshop [5_], the following relationships were identified as prime
candidates for linking:

 * the find spot of an inscription or coin
 * evidence for existence of a person or place in an inscription
 * evidence for existence or characteristics of a person on a coin
 * the place of birth or citizenship of an ancient person
 * the place of manufacture of a coin

This is not the entire set of relationships among web resources representing or
describing entities of the ancient world, but is a set sufficient to initiate a
graph that encodes knowledge, promotes discovery of resources, and advances the
field. The Web and Semantic Web [6_] operate under the "open world" assumption,
and so does Concordia. Discrete web resources must be identified via discrete
URIs, but the initial relationships Concordia establishes between resources do
not in any way preclude the existence of any other relationships. 

Links and Vocabularies
======================

On the non-semantic Web of HTML documents, relationships between resources are
marked up using the <a> tag. Here is one common form::

  origin: <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/639166">Xanthos</a>

A human can make use of this description – which asserts that the subject of
the current page element (an inscription, in this case) originates from a place
named "Xanthos" – but a machine can have no such sense. To a search engine,
then, all such links say no more than that the web resource at the given URI
(http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/639166) is "related" in some way to the
subject of the current page element.

The primary Concordia relationships cannot be unambiguously expressed using the
form above. For example, a machine cannot discriminate between the semantics of
the following two lines unless it has been given specific information about the
plain-text conventions used at each web site (a non-standard and non-scaling
proposition)::

  origin: <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/639166">Xanthos</a>
  attests to: <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/639166">Xanthos</a>
  
A small step toward disambiguating these is achieved by the following form::

  <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/639166">origin (Xanthos)</a>
  <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/639166">attests to (Xanthos)</a>
  
The strings "origin" and "attests to" within the <a> tags constitute a simple
link type vocabulary. All that remains to make these sensible to a machine is
to publish the types themselves on the web at permanent URIs, and use those
URIs in a rel attribute::

  <a 
    rel="ov:origin" 
    href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/639166"
    >
    Xanthos
  </a>
  <a
    rel="ov:attestsTo"
    href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/639166"
    >
    Xanthos
  </a>

where "ov" is the vocabulary's namespace prefix. The syntax used in the markup
above is called RDFa [7_], a standard that will play a major role in the future
of the Semantic Web.

On The CIDOC CRM
====================================

There are existing property or link relation vocabularies originating in the
past-oriented digital humanities, the most notable being the CIDOC Conceptual
Reference Model (CRM). The CRM is detailed, precise, and enjoys use in the
design of museum databases. It is not, however, used openly on the web. Our
assessment, which involved both web searches and an inquiry on the CIDOC CRM
email list, has yielded no example of CRM properties being used to link ancient
world data into an open, world-wide graph.

Considering now the inscription, coin, and place descriptions currently
published on the web: the fine structure of the CRM has serious implications
for the integration of these existing resources. Using the simple vocabulary of
2 terms shown in the previous section, we can immediately make a graph of
resources as they exist now, without any remodelling, with no need to mint new
resources:

If Concordia were to restrict itself to only the CRM properties, two problems
would rise. New "event" resources would become necessary to mediate complicated
relationships replacing the simple "ov:origin" property, and Concordia would
lose the ability to indicate that one resource provides evidence for the
existence or historicity of another. The situation is shown below:

.. image:: http://atlantides.org/trac/concordia/attachment/wiki/ConcordiaThesaurus/crm.png?format=raw

What CRM property or combination of properties and new entities is to replace
ov:attestsTo is not clear. Within CRM, it can be stated that a coin *depicts* a
person, or that an inscription *is about* a person, but we are not comfortable
with the assertion that these properties equal attestation. The ov:attestsTo
relationship emphasizes evidentiary function in the context of historical
analysis (e.g., a particular inscribed text attests to the use of a particular
geographic name variant), whereas the *depicts* and *is about* relationships
communicate just two of the conclusions that might be drawn from such analysis.

The new "finding event" or "minting event" resources (shown as red boxes in the
diagram above) might one day be very useful in their own right, but Concordia
needs to stick to practical rather than hypothetical objectives. Due to the
short time-frame of the project, a requirement that new event resources be
created for every origin relationship would stop the show. This is by far the
greater of the two problems.

At any rate, the "open world" assumption of the web (and Concordia) does not
rule out the future creation of event resources, nor the future use of CRM
properties to relate resources initially bound together using Concordia's
simpler vocabulary.  In fact, it seems obvious that CRM will play an important
future role in enriching a graph that is bootstrapped using a simpler, more
generic vocabulary.
